        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- need to add breakpoints -->
        <p>I've always had a passion for learning and an obsession with doing the best I can. In 2023 I graduated from Sam Houston State University while majoring in History and minoring in Technical Writing.
            My degree is a reflection of my love of researching new things, as well as my ability to convey information with concision. I began participating in an SMU Full Stack web development bootcamp at the beginning of September 2023.
            Since joining the bootcamp I began to learn about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. These skills allowed me to create many web applications. Five of these web applications are showcased below along with ways to view them and get in contact with me.
            Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio, I look forward to any future dealings we may have. 
        </p>
